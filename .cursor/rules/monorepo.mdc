# Your rule content

This is a monorepo, containing backend and frontend folders. Always install frontend related content under frontend folder and backend related content to backend. If you install a new package in backend, make sure you update requirements.txt and setup.sh and setup.bat if needed. Always use strict types instead of any in TypeScript.
