# Backend Async/Await Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Primary Issue: Incorrect Await Usage with Supabase**

**Problem**: The backend was trying to `await` Supabase `.execute()` calls, but both sync and async Supabase clients return response objects immediately, not coroutines.

**Error Messages**:
- `"object SingleAPIResponse[TypeVar] can't be used in 'await' expression"`
- `"object APIResponse[TypeVar] can't be used in 'await' expression"`

### 2. **Fixed Files**

#### `/apps/backend/utils/logging.py`
**Lines Fixed**: 75 and 115

**Before (Incorrect)**:
```python
# Line 75
chat_record = await async_supabase.table("chats").select("user_id").eq("id", chat_id).single().execute()

# Line 115  
await async_supabase.table("llm_usage").insert(usage_data).execute()
```

**After (Correct)**:
```python
# Line 75
chat_record = async_supabase.table("chats").select("user_id").eq("id", chat_id).single().execute()

# Line 115
async_supabase.table("llm_usage").insert(usage_data).execute()
```

### 3. **Why Only One Widget Was Created**

Looking at the logs, the issue wasn't with the multi-widget logic but with the user prompt:

**User Prompt**: `"Starting dashboard conversation..."`

This is a generic conversation starter, not a specific request for multiple visualizations. The agent correctly:

1. ✅ Identified it as a dashboard initialization request
2. ✅ Created one appropriate widget (KPI for total sales revenue)
3. ✅ Attempted to visualize it in multiple formats (KPI, table, bar, area)

**The agent followed the correct workflow**:
- Analyzed the prompt
- Determined user wanted a dashboard overview
- Created a single KPI widget showing total sales revenue
- Attempted multiple visualization types for that single widget

### 4. **Widget Generation Errors**

The widget generation was failing due to the async/await issues in the logging function. The sequence was:

1. ✅ `coordinator_agent` receives request
2. ✅ `sql_agent` generates SQL successfully (`SELECT SUM(SALES) AS total_sales_revenue FROM csv_data;`)
3. ✅ `viz_agent` creates visualizations (KPI, table, bar, area charts)
4. ❌ `_log_llm()` function fails due to incorrect await usage
5. ❌ Widget creation marked as failed

### 5. **Technical Root Cause**

**Supabase Client Behavior**:
- Both `supabase` (sync) and `async_supabase` clients return response objects immediately
- The `.execute()` method is **not** a coroutine and should **not** be awaited
- Response objects contain `.data`, `.error`, etc. properties

**Correct Usage Pattern**:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
response = async_supabase.table("chats").select("user_id").execute()
user_id = response.data[0]["user_id"] if response.data else None

# ❌ INCORRECT 
response = await async_supabase.table("chats").select("user_id").execute()
```

### 6. **Multi-Widget Generation**

To trigger multi-widget generation, users need to make requests like:
- "Create a sales dashboard with multiple views"
- "Show me sales analysis with different chart types"
- "Give me a comprehensive overview of the data"

The current prompt `"Starting dashboard conversation..."` is correctly interpreted as a single-widget initialization.

### 7. **Verification Steps**

After these fixes:

1. ✅ Async/await errors should be resolved
2. ✅ Widget creation should complete successfully
3. ✅ LLM usage logging should work properly
4. ✅ Chat message history should update correctly

### 8. **Additional Issues Found**

#### Logfire Warning
```
Failed to introspect calling code. Please report this issue to Logfire.
```

**Solution**: Add `inspect_arguments=False` to `logfire.configure()` to suppress this warning.

#### Data Encoding Warning
```
UTF-8 encoding failed for http://127.0.0.1:54321/storage/v1/object/public/test-bucket/dashboards/KqJuKT_ho8BdRPk40JX-N/sales_data_sample.csv?, trying utf8-lossy: invalid utf-8 sequence
```

**Note**: This is a file encoding issue, not related to the async/await problems.

## Summary

The main issue was in the logging utility trying to await non-awaitable Supabase response objects. The agent workflow and multi-widget logic were working correctly - the user just provided a generic conversation starter rather than a specific multi-widget request.

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `/apps/backend/utils/logging.py` - Fixed lines 75 and 115

**Expected Behavior After Fix**:
- Widget creation should complete successfully
- No more async/await errors in logs
- LLM usage tracking should work properly
- Multi-widget generation will work when requested with appropriate prompts
